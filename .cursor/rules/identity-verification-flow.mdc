# Identity Verification Flow Specification

## 1. Multi-Step Verification Process

### Passport Verification Path
- NFC chip data extraction and validation
- Document Signer Certificate (DSC) verification
- Zero-knowledge proof generation for privacy
- Multi-stage attestation verification
- Cross-chain verification support

### EU ID Card Verification Path
- Similar process to passport verification
- Additional EU-specific compliance checks
- Regional document format validation

## 2. Proof Verification Pipeline

### Register Circuit Verification
- Identity commitment generation and validation
- Nullifier creation to prevent duplicate registrations
- Merkle tree inclusion proofs for privacy

### DSC Proof Verification
- Document Signer Certificate validation
- Cryptographic signature verification
- Certificate chain validation

### Disclosure Proof Verification
- Selective attribute revelation
- Privacy-preserving age verification
- Granular document field disclosure

## 3. Attestation Workflows

### User Identifier Verification
- User identifier verification through double-hashing with domain separation:
  H2 = Hash("IDH" || Hash("IDH" || userIdentifier))
- Attestation storage with nullifier tracking
- Support for cross-chain verification results

### Verification Result Management
- Secure storage of verification results
- Privacy-preserving result sharing
- Audit trail maintenance
