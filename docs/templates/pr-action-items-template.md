<!--
INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENTS:

CRITICAL FILTERING RULES - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. ONLY include comments that meet ALL criteria:
   ‚úÖ NO "‚úÖ Addressed" status (must be truly unresolved)
   ‚úÖ NO "nitpick" or "suggestion" labels (medium+ severity only)
   ‚úÖ MEDIUM to CRITICAL impact (affects functionality, security, or architecture)
   ‚úÖ NOT cosmetic/style issues (unless security/performance related)
   ‚úÖ DO NOT include secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, MRZ data, or any PII. Redact sensitive values and replace with placeholders.

2. VERIFICATION PROCESS - MANDATORY:
   - Read EACH comment's status field carefully
   - Check for "‚úÖ Addressed in commits X to Y" text
   - Verify comment type: "üõ†Ô∏è Refactor suggestion", "‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issue", etc.
   - Exclude: style, formatting, naming, documentation-only suggestions
   - Include: security, memory leaks, breaking changes, API inconsistencies, platform compatibility

3. SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION:
   - CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, breaking platform compatibility
   - HIGH: API inconsistencies, type safety issues, significant architectural problems
   - MEDIUM: Test coverage gaps, minor architectural improvements, performance concerns
   - LOW/NITPICK: Style, naming, documentation, minor suggestions (EXCLUDE THESE)

4. DOUBLE-CHECK PROCESS:
   - After initial analysis, re-read ALL comments
   - Verify each "unresolved" issue is actually unresolved
   - Remove any that have been addressed in subsequent commits
   - If NO unresolved medium+ issues exist, state "All issues resolved ‚úÖ"
   - Run a final pass to ensure no credentials, secrets, or PII are present in examples, logs, or screenshots.

5. EXECUTION:
   - Use giga_read_pr to fetch PR data and CodeRabbit comments
   - Group related issues by root cause (not just severity)
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers from CodeRabbit metadata
   - Provide clear, actionable fixes with code examples
   - Prioritize by "blocking merge" vs "architectural" vs "polish"
   - Create file as PR-{{NUMBER}}-ACTION-ITEMS.md in project root
   - Follow gitignore pattern: PR-*-ACTION*.md
